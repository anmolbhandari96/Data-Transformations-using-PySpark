Overview
This repository contains a collection of data transformation scripts and utilities I have developed and used for various data processing tasks. The primary goal of this repository is to showcase the transformation logic that can be applied to raw data to convert it into meaningful insights for analytics and reporting. The repository also includes a sample dataset for testing the transformation scripts and serves as a sample input for the various transformation functions. You can use this dataset as-is or modify it to suit your own use cases.

Features
Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and transforming raw data into a standardized format.
Data Aggregation: Aggregating data for analysis using grouping, summing, and averaging techniques.
Data Type Conversion: Converting columns into appropriate data types such as integers, floats, dates, etc.
Data Filtering and Transformation: Implementing various filters, conditional transformations, and custom logic to prepare data for further analysis.
Sample Transformations: Specific transformation examples such as converting currency, handling timestamp formats, and reshaping data for analysis.
